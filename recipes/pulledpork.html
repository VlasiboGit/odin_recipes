        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sauce: Place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.</li>
            <li>Spread the sauce thickly over the pork and put it in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave it to marinate in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Put the pork and sauce into a slow cooker and place on the low heat setting for 8-10 hours, without opening the lid, or until the pork is very tender. Or, cook in a covered dish in the oven at 140°C/275°F/Gas Mark 1 for about 6-8 hours, or until the meat is tender, basting it occasionally with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Remove the pork from the slow cooker or oven and leave it to rest for about 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Pour the liquid into a small pan and skim off any fat. Boil to reduce and thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Place the pork on a board and cut off the skin and any visible fat. Use 2 forks to shred the meat into small pieces and stir into the sauce. Serve hot in baps, along with coleslaw and chips</li>
